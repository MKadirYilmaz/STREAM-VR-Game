Base C++ codes of META SIU! VR Game.

----- Blueprint codes will not work in this environment because of some of the missing contents such as 3D models, textures and materials. -----

The biggest challenge with this project was time. I had only a few months to learn how to develop a game in VR and make it. While I was programming, I tried to keep things as organized as I could, but in the end, some things might look unorganized because of lack of time.

Gameplay logic were made %65 using C++ codes and %35 using Blueprint system.
